# MagicDeviceID
This is magic DeviceID tool. It works different on the different platforms. The complicatest way is on iOS devices. It generate magic unique password and save it in iTunes with App name like login-password pair. In the future I want to improve this tool and give it optional method that saves this deviceId in the Google Play to link ID with Google Play account.

Spoiler: the main author of the tool is not me.
